Telco traffic visualisation with node.js
========================================

Prerequisites:
--------------
node.js: download from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
npm: download from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

First time only:
----------------
In the checked out/cloned folder, execute:
    npm install

Configure:
----------
Edit the file conf/application.json

Most notably, you may want to edit the location of geofence.file to the same location of the geofence.file parameter in
botkop:botkop-telcotraffic-spark/src/main/resources/application.conf
Or you can do as I do, and use a symbolic link.
The thing is, if you put then to the same physical file, this will be picked up by by the spark job.

Run:
----
Execute:
    node server.js
